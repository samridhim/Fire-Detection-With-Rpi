This project was made as a part of Embedded Systems and IoT course of SPPU TE 2015.

The goal of this project is to sense smoke levels in the room and notify the user by sending an email and ringing the buzzer in case a fire occurs
Since Fires have a significant amount of CO percentage, it becomes sensible to use a CO sensor. That is what we have used in this 
project.
